Please feel free to adjust these paths as needed under the "Setting Paths" cell in the Python Notebook.

The "path" folder includes all of my scraped data as well as my plotted figures.
The "external" folder includes all external CSV files utilized when merging to create a larger dataset for regressions.
The "driver_path" variable must have the set path for the Chrome driver.

My final data file is named "speechfinal.csv"

<br>

All data has been webscraped from The Federal Reserve's Board of Governors speech archive at, https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speeches.htm.
Additionally, earlier data was collected from, https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/speeches-archive.htm, for speeches before 2006.

The RMD file contains all three of my regression models used. The regression outputs are saved in the main area of the repository under the names "model1.html" and "model2and3.html".
